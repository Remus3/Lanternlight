# Observed engine ids

First-party observations read out of `%LOCALAPPDATA%\MistfallHunter\Saved\Logs\
MistfallHunter.log`. Nothing here is from a wiki. Each row says how it was
established, because the log emits NUMBERS and never a class name string - every
id-to-name binding therefore rests on an operator observation made at the same
moment, not on the log alone.

Game build: Steam buildid `24619162`. Observed 2026-08-09.

## Class ids

Log line: `TS.Dungeon: [basedatacomponent] setClassGender inclassid ==NN, inGender ==N`

| classId | Class | How established |
|---|---|---|
| 10 | **Mercenary** | pixel-joined, 2026-08-09 |
| 11 | **Sorcerer** | pixel-joined, 2026-08-09 |
| 12 | **Blackarrow** | pixel-joined AND operator-attested - the committed character logged `classId 12` |
| 13 | **Shadowstrix** | pixel-joined, 2026-08-09 |
| 14 | **Seer** | pixel-joined, 2026-08-09 |
| 15 | **Withered Knight** | by elimination plus sidebar order; the ROLE panel for it was not captured |

**Complete. 10-15, ascending, matching the in-game sidebar order top to bottom.**

### Method - how "pixel-joined" was established

The log emits `setClassGender inclassid ==NN` with a UTC timestamp. A passive
desktop poller captured the screen every 3s with local-time filenames. Local is
UTC-5, so the two streams join on wall clock. Reading the class NAME off the
ROLE panel in the frame that closes each dwell window gives name-to-id directly.
No process access, no OCR guesswork - the name is rendered text read from a
screenshot.

One wrinkle worth recording: **the ROLE description panel lags the selection by
about one frame, while the left sidebar highlight leads it.** So in the frame at
the instant class 13 is set, the panel still reads "Blackarrow" (class 12) and
the sidebar has already moved to Shadowstrix. Both halves agree with the log,
which is what makes the join trustworthy rather than a coincidence. Read the
panel for the OUTGOING class and the sidebar for the INCOMING one.

Reproduce with [`tools/frame_poller.py`](../tools/frame_poller.py) plus the log
grep for `setClassGender inclassid`.

## Gender ids

| genderId | Meaning | How established |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Body type 1 | inferred from pairing with 2 |
| 2 | **Body type 2 (Female)** | **operator-attested** - operator selected body type 2, character logged `gender 2` |

## Weapon config ids seen in character creation

Log line: `TS.Avatar: [AvatarComponent] server_refreshKnightFeature: <actor> class-NN holding-NNNNN`

Two preview actors exist and the log labels them by gender
(`BP_Preview_C_...781` = gender-1, `BP_Preview_C_...772` = gender-2).

| classId | Class | holding ids seen | count |
|---|---|---|---|
| 10 | Mercenary | 30401, 30402 | 2 |
| 11 | Sorcerer | 30503 | 1 |
| 12 | Blackarrow | 30504 | 1 |
| 13 | Shadowstrix | 30505, 30506 | 2 |
| 14 | Seer | 30507, 30508 | 2 |
| 15 | Withered Knight | 30409, 30410 | 2 |

Four classes carry two weapon ids, two carry one. The pair count lines up with
the published weapon kits - Mercenary is Hammer plus Sword and Shield,
Shadowstrix is Dagger plus Dual Blades - so **pairs are the two weapon stances,
not gender mesh variants.** The gender-variant hypothesis is refuted: gender
variants would apply uniformly across all six classes, and they do not.

Blackarrow showing a single id **independently corroborates the official
statement that its second weapon ships in a future season.** That corroboration
is worth more than the statement alone, because it was measured here rather than
read from a patch note.

**Still open:** Sorcerer also shows a single id, which the official line does not
account for. Either Sorcerer is genuinely single-weapon too, or its second
weapon was not surfaced during this walk. Do not write "Blackarrow is the only
single-weapon class" anywhere until this is settled.

Note the id space is NOT class-ordered: Withered Knight sits at 304xx alongside
Mercenary, while the middle four sit at 305xx. Do not infer class from an id
range.

## Weapon-stance toggle probe - NOT YET RUN

Step 4 of the capture plan (hold on one class, cycle the stance toggle, watch
whether `holding-` changes) did not produce a distinguishable event in this
session. The pair-versus-singleton evidence above arrives from the carousel
instead, which is weaker for the stance question specifically. Re-run
deliberately when convenient.

## Post-creation

The committed character emits `BP_Adventurer_C_<id> class-12 holding-3010401`.
Note the id width: creation previews use 5-digit weapon ids (`30504`), the live
character uses a 7-digit id (`3010401`). These are different id spaces - most
likely a weapon config id versus an item instance or item config id. Do not join
them without evidence.

## Rule

Every future id binding gets recorded here at the moment it is observed, with
the observation method named. An id learned six weeks later from a wiki is not
the same fact as an id watched being emitted.
