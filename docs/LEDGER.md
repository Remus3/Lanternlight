# Lanternlight ledger

The per-item record of what actually landed. One entry per item, **newest
first**, each carrying the acceptance evidence that justified calling it done.

This file exists because continuity in this project lives on disk, not in a
context window. A session that has been cleared or compacted reads the top few
entries here, plus `ROADMAP.md` and `git log`, and knows where it is. Nothing
about the work is expected to survive in conversation.

## Format

Each entry is a level-3 heading followed by its evidence:

```
### LL-0000 - YYYY-MM-DD - one-line summary of what changed

**Evidence:**
- the test, file, or command that proves it
- one line per piece of evidence
```

`ops/loop/ledger.py` writes these. It inserts new entries directly below the
marker line at the bottom of this preamble, and it writes atomically through a
temporary file, so a reader polling this file never sees a half-written entry.

## Append-only

Entries are added. They are never edited, reordered, reflowed or deleted. If an
entry turns out to be wrong, the correction is a **new entry** that says so and
names the entry it corrects. The value of a ledger is that it is a record; a
record that can be quietly revised - especially by an unattended loop - is
worth nothing.

## Do not verify an entry by its commit hash

Entries may cite a commit. Treat that citation as a hint, not as proof, and
expect a meaningful share of older hashes to resolve to nothing.

This is not history rewriting and it is not corruption. Work is done on
branches and in worktrees; when a branch is squashed on merge, or a commit is
cherry-picked onto another branch, the sha that existed when the entry was
written stops existing. The change still landed. Only its address moved.

**Verify by file and by test.** Open the file the entry names and read it; run
the test the entry names and watch it pass. Those survive squash, rebase,
cherry-pick and reclone. A hash does not. If a hash is dead and the file and
test check out, the entry is good - do not reopen the item, and do not "fix"
the history.

## Item ids

`LL-NNNN`, allocated in order, never reused. An id that appears in a roadmap
item, a branch name, a commit message and a ledger entry is what ties those
four records to each other.

### LL-0001 - 2026-08-09 - Repository scaffold and autonomy stack

**Evidence:**
- `ops/loop/state.py` persists cycle, directive, in-flight item, timestamp and completed ids to `ops/runtime/loop_state.json` through a temp-then-`Path.replace()` write
- `ops/loop/guard.py` takes an `O_CREAT | O_EXCL` lock carrying the owning pid, reclaims a lock whose pid is gone, and never terminates anything
- `ops/loop/ledger.py` inserts entries below the marker in this file, atomically, with a pre-write check that existing content is preserved byte for byte
- `tests/test_loop_state.py` and `tests/test_loop_guard.py` cover default-on-missing, round trip, corrupt-file recovery, write atomicity, acquire, refusal of a second acquire, stale reclaim and release
- `docs/HEADLESS.md` records the per-cycle procedure and the stop conditions the loop must never violate unattended
- `python -m ruff check ops tests` clean; `python -m pytest` green

**Notes:** the loop's continuity contract - git history, this ledger,
`ROADMAP.md` and the directive chain in `ops/runtime/loop_state.json` - is
stated in `ops/loop/__init__.py` and must hold for a session started with an
empty context.
